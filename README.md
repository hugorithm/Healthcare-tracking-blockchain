Healthcare Data Tracking Blockchain Network
![Hyperledger](blockchain.png)

This is the project that I chose for my Master's Dissertation. 
It is a Blockchain Network based on Hyperledger Fabric that is used to track Healthcare patient data through various beacons. 
It integrates a Web API in Node.js for asset creation, modification and has support for asset querying, as well as, various Blockchain monitoring software: 

- Blockchain Explorer
- Hyperledger Caliper
- Prometheus
- Grafana.

It started at the Hospital of S. Jo√£o in Oporto, where there were clear issues regarding data immutability and veracity. 
This project uses Blockchain Technology to ensure a tamper-proof, immutable, controlled, and secured way of storing data in order to achieve healthcare data veracity, privacy, and reliability.
